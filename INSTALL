		------------------------------------
		Installation of	XBase and DBD::XBase
		------------------------------------

To use the XBase.pm module, perl version 5.004 is required. (Please do
not ask me to make these modules work under 5.003 or older version --
upgrade instead.) To use the DBD::XBase driver, you need a DBI module
version 1.0 or higher. (If you have older DBI and cannot upgrade for
some reason, check the CPAN for DBD::XBase version < 0.090. Those are
the last versions that do not require DBI 1.0.)

Installation is the same as for any Perl module, so if you have some
obscure platform, check instructions that came with perl for that
platform -- I won't be able to help you because I probably do not use
your platform.

Download the DBD-XBase-x.xx.tar.gz, unpack it, change to the
DBD-XBase-x.xx directory. Then do

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You can also use the CPAN.pm module to do these steps for you

	$ perl -MCPAN -e shell
	cpan> install DBD::XBase

If you do not have root access on that machine and/or cannot install
into standard Perl library directories, you can specify alternate
location with

	$ perl Makefile.PL LIB=/your/directory \
		INSTALLMAN1DIR=/path/for/man1 \
		INSTALLMAN3DIR=/path/for/man3

instead of just perl Makefile.PL, and in your scripts do
				   
	use lib '/your/directory';
	use XBase;
or
	use lib '/your/directory';
	use DBI;

If you do not have make or you cannot run it (do you really want to
use Perl on that machine?), just copy the content of the
DBD-XBase-x.xx/lib directory to wherever you want to have it. That
should work, even if it won't give you man pages and dbfdump/indexdump
scripts.

If you use a platform supported by ActiveState and run ActiveState
perl, you can use ppm to install the module. Please note that I have
no way of influencing what version of XBase.pm/DBD::XBase ActiveState
offers on their site -- contact them if you need newer version which
is only on CPAN.

		------------------------------------
		Problems and bug reporting for XBase
		------------------------------------

If anything goes wrong when installing/make test, please send me
output of your installation messages and of

	$ make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

Each version of the module is tested on IRIX, Linux and Solaris
before releasing but surely there might be situation where something
is corrupted on other platforms. If you send me reasonable output and
it is a bug of XBase.pm/DBD::XBase, these errors are typically fixed
in a matter of hours (unless I'm gone for a vacation).

If there are errors when actually using the module on your data,
please check first that it's really a XBase/DBD::XBase problem (for
example, did you FTP your files using binary mode?). If so, please
send me example of your script, the errstr messages you get and (if
possible) your data files that cause the problems and description
of what output you expected. If there is problem with writing the
data, send me the file before and after the action and also describe
what you expect and what you got. Add info about your OS, version of
Perl and other modules that might be relevant. You can of course
also send patches to actual bugs. I may respond with requests for
particular tests and actions to try on your machine.

Mention the word "XBase" in the Subject line, otherwise your post
will probably just slip through my xxx MB daily email load without
even being read. Please note that I'm _very_ busy, so try to help me
to help you by using the latest version of the module, minimalizing
the script code that causes you problems, providing me with tiny
sample datafile, anything that might be related. Detailed description
and small examples are the best.
